**Date:** 5 January 2026
## What has been completed on this screen
- Guided breathing session with:
  - Inhale
  - Hold In
  - Exhale
  - Hold Out
- Customizable duration for each breathing phase
- Selectable breathing cycle count
- Preparation countdown before the session starts (“Get Ready”)
- Breathing animation synced with breathing phases
- Play, pause, resume, and cancel controls
- Remaining time indicator for each breathing phase
- Cycle progress indicator (current cycle / total cycles)
- Ambient background audio during the breathing session
- Audio continues playing when the phone screen is locked
- Mute / unmute control for background audio (just apply when the player is active)
- Session completion state (“Well done”)
- When the value of the phase and cycle changed, the session should be back inactive (active session should be cancelled).
- Add cues for each phase (inhale, exhale, hold)
- Add preset library and hold in/hold out value can be zero/skipped.

**Date:** 8 January 2026
- Haptics added to breathing phases:
  - Distinct haptic feedback for inhale, exhale, and hold phases
  - Haptics triggered on phase transitions
  - Consistent behavior across pause / resume
- Scene system added for guided breathing sessions
  - Waterfall, River, and Beach scenes
- Scene selection screen with horizontal scrollable cards
- Persistent scene selection using local repository (UserDefaults)
- Scene settings navigation:
  - Settings button added to the breathing screen
  - Navigates to scene selection screen
  - Active breathing session is cancelled when entering scene settings
- Background image dynamically updates based on selected scene
- Background ambient audio dynamically updates based on selected scene
- Seamless scene switching while session is active:
  - Audio restarts with the newly selected scene
  - Playback respects mute state

**Date:** 9 January 2026
- - Cycle configuration improvements:
  - Cycle count expanded from 1–10 to 1–60
  - Cycle duration dynamically calculated based on phase settings
  - UI now displays both cycle count and total estimated duration
- Cycle selector UI refactor:
  - Replaced cycle dropdown menu with an inline slider
  - Slider placed below phase configuration for better discoverability
  - Live duration text updates as the slider moves
- Breathing player layout stabilization:
  - Phase selector hidden during active breathing session
  - Scene settings toolbar button hidden while session is active
- Breathing animation improvements:
  - Smooth breathing animation driven by elapsed time
  - Animation correctly pauses and resumes without restarting phases
- Pre-session user guidance:
  - Pre-session warning shown before starting breathing
- Apple Watch communication:
  - Pre-session message sent from iOS to Apple Watch
  - Watch receives cycle count and total duration
  - Watch pre-session reminder view implemented

## Notes
- The items above describe the **logic and behavior** of the breathing session, not the final visual design.
- The breathing flow, timing, background handling, and audio behavior are implemented using **Clean Architecture**, separating logic from UI design.
- Because of this separation:
  - The **background visuals** (colors, images, animations) can be changed later without affecting the breathing logic.
  - The **sound or audio style** (e.g. birds, silence, different ambience) can be easily replaced or adjusted without reworking the session flow.
- The current implementation prioritizes **correct behavior, background support, and stability**.
- **The breathing session is not yet connected to Apple Health / Mindfulness (HealthKit)**.
  - This can be added later once the breathing experience and session rules are finalized.
- **iOS version targeting, glass-style visual effects, and Dark Mode styling are not configured yet**.
  - These will be addressed after the final design direction is confirmed.
- Once the design, platform targets, and HealthKit direction are confirmed, visual, audio, and system integrations can be applied safely and quickly.

**Date:** 6 January 2026
## What has been completed on this screen
- Implemented Live Activity support for the breathing session using ActivityKit.
- Added Dynamic Island UI:
  - Compact state: icon on the left, remaining time on the right.
  - Expanded state: breathing phase (Inhale / Hold / Exhale) and countdown timer.
  - Minimal state: icon-only display.
- Added Lock Screen Live Activity UI showing:
  - Current breathing phase.
  - Remaining seconds.
- Implemented a dedicated Live Activity controller in the main app to:
  - Start the Live Activity when the breathing session begins.
  - Update phase and remaining time during the session.
  - End the Live Activity when the session completes or is cancelled.
- Properly separated logic (app target) and UI (widget extension target) following Apple’s Live Activity architecture.
- Ensured the breathing session can continue and remain visible via Live Activity when the app is backgrounded or the screen is locked.

Notes
- This implementation focuses on the logic flow and system behavior, not final visual design.



# Wellobit – Sleep tracking
**Date:** 10 January 2026

## What has been completed on this screen
- Implemented **HealthKit sleep permission flow**
  - Requested read access for:
    - Sleep Analysis
    - Heart Rate
    - HRV (SDNN)
    - Respiratory Rate
- Implemented **latest sleep session fetching**
  - Retrieved last night’s sleep window from HealthKit
  - Corrected sleep grouping logic to use **wake-up date (endDate)** instead of startDate
  - Displayed:
    - Total sleep duration
    - Sleep time range (start → end)
- Implemented **sleep stage breakdown**
  - Parsed sleep stages (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
  - Aggregated duration per stage
  - Displayed stage durations in the Sleep Details section
- Implemented **historical sleep data fetching**
  - Fetched daily sleep summaries for:
    - 1 Week
    - 2 Weeks
    - 1 Month
    - 3 Months
  - Ensured missing days are handled gracefully (no data → 0 duration)
- Implemented **average metrics calculation per timeframe**
  - Average sleep duration
  - Average heart rate
  - Average HRV
  - Average respiratory rate
  - Designed averages to remain visible even if optional metrics are unavailable
