- Preparation countdown before the session starts (“Get Ready”)
- Breathing animation synced with breathing phases

## Notes
- The items above describe the **logic and behavior** of the breathing session.
- The feature is implemented using **Clean Architecture**, separating logic from UI design.
- This makes future design or UI changes easier to apply without rewriting the core breathing logic.
- The current implementation focuses on correctness, stability, and background behavior; visual refinements can be iterated on safely in later phases.
